"""Main module of the project.

This module provides functionality to read URLs from a specified file, validate them,
and download the associated content. It manages the entire download process by
leveraging asynchronous operations, allowing for efficient handling of multiple URLs.

Usage:
    To run the module, execute the script directly. It will process URLs listed in
    'URLs.txt' and log the session activities in 'session.log'.
